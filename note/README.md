# Math494-Notes

This repo contains my lecture notes and personal thoughts on the course Math494 26WN.

My course instructor is [Prof. Mircea Mustață](https://websites.umich.edu/~mmustata/).

If you spot any typos or if you have any suggestions, please open an issue, I am very happy to discuss any of it.

Since it is during the semester, the repo will be updated across the lectures.
